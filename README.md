2.  Navigate to the project directory.
3.  Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Run the Next.js development server:**
    This will start the main application, typically on `http://localhost:9002`.
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

2.  **Run the Genkit development server (for AI features):**

    ```

##  Powered Features

CollabDraw leverages Google's Genkit to integrate powerful AI capabilities. The application includes a pre-built flow for clarifying ambiguous feedback (e.g., "make it better"). When a user provides such feedback, the AI can generate several more specific and actionable suggestions, helping to bridge communication gaps in the creative process.
